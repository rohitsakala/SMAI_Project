<p>I'm trying to write a program in ARMSIM that does the following:<br> Open a file named "integers.dat" and keep track of the following information:<br> the first integer value (i)<br> the second integer value (j)<br> the total number of integers in the file<br> the number of integers that are not i<br> the total number of integers less than j  </p>  <p>So far I have the following from the ARMSIM guide</p>  <pre><code>@@@ OPEN INPUT FILE, READ INTEGER FROM FILE, PRINT IT, CLOSE INPUT FILE   .equ SWI_Open, 0x66         @open a file  .equ SWI_Close,0x68         @close a file .equ SWI_PrChr,0x00         @ Write an ASCII char to Stdout  .equ SWI_PrStr, 0x69        @ Write a null-ending string  .equ SWI_PrInt,0x6b         @ Write an Integer  .equ SWI_RdInt,0x6c         @ Read an Integer from a file  .equ Stdout, 1          @ Set output target to be Stdout  .equ SWI_Exit, 0x11         @ Stop execution  .global _start  .text _start: @ print an initial message to the screen  mov R0,#Stdout          @print an initial message  ldr R1, =Message1       @ load address of Message1 label  swi SWI_PrStr           @ display message to Stdout   @ == Open an input file for reading =============================  @ if problems, print message to Stdout and exit  ldr r0,=InFileName      @ set Name for input file  mov r1,#0           @ mode is input  swi SWI_Open            @ open file for input  bcs InFileError         @ Check Carry-Bit (C): if= 1 then ERROR @ Save the file handle in memory:  ldr r1,=InputFileHandle         @ if OK, load input file handle  str r0,[r1]                 @ save the file handle   @ == Read integers until end of file =============================  RLoop:  ldr r0,=InputFileHandle     @ load input file handle  ldr r0,[r0]  swi SWI_RdInt           @ read the integer into R0  bcs EofReached          @ Check Carry-Bit (C): if= 1 then EOF reached  @ print the integer to Stdout  mov r1,r0           @ R1 = integer to print  mov R0,#Stdout          @ target is Stdout  swi SWI_PrInt  mov R0,#Stdout          @ print new line  ldr r1, =NL  swi SWI_PrStr  bal RLoop           @ keep reading till end of file  @ == End of file ===============================================  EofReached:  mov R0, #Stdout         @ print last message  ldr R1, =EndOfFileMsg  swi SWI_PrStr  @ == Close a file =============================================== ldr R0, =InFileHandle       @ get address of file handle  ldr R0, [R0]            @ get value at address  swi SWI_Close  Exit:  swi SWI_Exit            @ stop executing  InFileError:  mov R0, #Stdout  ldr R1, =FileOpenInpErrMsg  swi SWI_PrStr  bal Exit            @ give up, go to end  .data  .align InFileHandle:       .skip       4  InFileName:         .asciz      "whatever.txt"  FileOpenInpErrMsg:  .asciz      "Failed to open input file \n"  EndOfFileMsg:       .asciz      "End of file reached\n"  ColonSpace:         .asciz": "  NL:             .asciz      "\n "   @ new line  Message1:       .asciz      "Hello World! \n"  .end </code></pre>  <p>When I run the code I get an error "unknown opcode or directive" for lines      11 through 18.</p>  <p>How do I modify this code to get the results I want?</p>
