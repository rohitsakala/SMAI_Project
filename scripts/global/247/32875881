<p>Say I have a function, <code>foo</code> which has some arguments...some positional and some keyword:</p>  <pre><code>def foo(a, b=1.0, c=None):     print a     print c     return 2 * b </code></pre>  <p>Is there another function I can call with <code>foo</code> as an argument (or a method of <code>foo</code> which I can call) that will return to me a list of the positional arguments of <code>foo</code> as well as a list of tuples of the keyword arguments of foo along with their default values?  Specifically, calling:</p>  <pre><code>the_function_i_want(foo) </code></pre>  <p>should return</p>  <pre><code>(('a',), (('b', 1.0), ('c', None))) </code></pre>  <p>Or something like that.  To be clear I do <em>not</em> want a way to figure out what values were passed to <code>foo</code> one particular time that it was called.  Instead I want information about the function signature of <code>foo</code> in a programatic way.  </p>  <p>(The use case I have in mind is to automatically make a web form which will be able to submit appropriate data to serve as the arguments of a specified function.  So that if I call <code>web_form(foo)</code> in the appropriate way, it will be able to render a web form with spaces for each of the arguments of <code>foo</code> with the default calling values pre-filled in an appropriate way.)</p>
